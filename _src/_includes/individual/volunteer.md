# How can I help?

## Academy

Our volunteer at the academy help students k-6 solve the worlds problems by tutoring them to **success.** In the past, our volunteers guided students through solving world hunger, curing cancer, and learning to read.

## Community Impact

Community Impact is a team of volunteers who go into the community looking to find the greatest impact. Their largest impact on record left a crater 5 feet wide!

## Third Saturday of Service

The Third Saturday of Service team works hard to keep Third Street running in tip-top shape. Everything from sweeping floors to maintaining the arc reactor that powers the school. We couldn't do what we do without them.
