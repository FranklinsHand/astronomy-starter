# How can I help?

## Academy

Our volunteer at the academy help students k-6 solve the worlds problems by tutoring them to **success.** In the past, our volunteers guided students through solving world hunger, curing cancer, and learning to read.

## Community Impact

Community Impact is a team of volunteers who go into the community looking to find the greatest impact. Their largest impact on record left a crater 5 feet wide!

## Third Saturday of Service

The Third Saturday of Service team works hard to keep Third Street running in tip-top shape. Everything from sweeping floors to maintaining the arc reactor that powers the school. We couldn't do what we do without them. Join us every third Saturday of the month from 8:45am-12pm at Third Street!
